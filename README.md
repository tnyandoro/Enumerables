# Enumerable module

This is project is an Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides lots of handy iterator methods.. This is to demonstrate the authors basic understanding of the ruby language concepts. To prove that there's no magic to it, we are going to rebuild those methods.
